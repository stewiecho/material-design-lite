# MDL Checkbox Example - Angular2

This folder contains a POC for using mdl-checkbox within Angular2.

It is based off of [angular2-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular2-seed)

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` within this folder
2. Run `npm start` to start the demo server
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the demo.

## Notes

The checkbox wrapper is implemented within `src/app/components/checkbox/checkbox.ts`. There are also
simple wrapper components for both the checkbox wrapper classes and the checkbox label (which is
implemented as a directive).
